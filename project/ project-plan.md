# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Greenhouse Gas Giants Analysis

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Does analyzing the emissions data of major carbon-emitting entities provide insights into their environmental impact and contribution to climate change?

## Description
<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The project aims to analyze the emissions data of major carbon-emitting entities, also known as "Carbon Majors," to understand their environmental impact and contribution to climate change. By analyzing this data, we can gain insights into the most significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions globally and identify trends over time. This analysis will help us understand the role of these companies in climate change and can inform policy-making and mitigation strategies.

## Datasources
<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
Datasource1: Carbon Majors Emissions Data

Data Type: CSV
Short description of the DataSource.
The Carbon Majors dataset contains information on the greenhouse gas emissions of major carbon-emitting entities. The dataset is updated annually and provides emissions data at different levels of granularity, including total emissions, commodity production, and operational emissions.
