# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Impact of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on Global Temperatures

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How do greenhouse gas emissions effect the global temperature changes from 1995 to 2020?

## Description
<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The purpose of this study is to examine the connection between variations in global temperature and greenhouse gas emissions during a 25-year span (1995-2020). Using temperature and emission records, statistical techniques will be applied to detect patterns, associations, and possibleÂ connections. 

## Datasources
<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
Datasource1: Global Temperature Data
Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhamjain/temperature-of-all-countries-19952020
Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhamjain/temperature-of-all-countries-19952020
Data Type: CSV
This dataset contains the temperature data for all countries from 1995 to 2020. It includes annual average temperatures which will be used to analyze temperature trends over time and across different regions.

Datasource2: CO and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data
Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/co-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions/data?select=2-+annual-co-emissions-by-region.csv
Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/co-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions/data?select=2-+annual-co-emissions-by-region.csv
Data Type: CSV
This dataset provides annual CO and other greenhouse gas emissions by region. It will be used to analyze emission trends and their potential impact on global temperatures.
